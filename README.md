# MV3D_Bash
This repository contains bash scripts written to improve the machine. 

The Leidos Security and Detection Systems Department produces a variety of explosive detection machines. In Turkey, there are 31 MV3D machines, and they are located to different cities. Istanbul Airport has 24 of them. I created bash scripts and desktop applications to improve and provide control of the MV3Ds. System uses Fedora10, some of the commands in the files may depracated on your system.
